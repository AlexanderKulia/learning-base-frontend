# Learning base (training project)

When you learn something, create a note and tag it. Later, filter your notes by tags to see what you have learned

Disclaimer: This project could have been built using many fewer dependecies, but I wanted to learn the libraries I used here since they are very widely used and make developer experience better

Stack:

- In-memory JWT authentication
- Material UI components

- Reusable dialogs (Context API)
- Reusable snackbars (Context API)
- Craco to override default CRA configuration of Babel and Jest
